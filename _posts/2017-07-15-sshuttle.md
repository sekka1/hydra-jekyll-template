sshuttle uses ssh and python to create a tunnel from your local machine to any
remote network you are able to ssh into.

This means that once you sshuttle into a machine, you can access any IP on that
remote network like you were directly connected to it.

Topology:

Your laptop (192.168.1.1) <---> Internet <---> (public IP) Remote SSH Host (10.1.1.10)

This will mean that once you sshuttle in from your local laptop you can ping IP
10.1.1.10 directly from your terminal like you were sitting on that network.
