				<h2>Managed Kubernetes Benefits</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>

						<li><p>Cost savings by only paying for your compute time, no need to pay for an entire cluster</p></li>
						<li><p>No need to hire a DevOps team to support your infrastructure. We can do it at-scale.</p></li>

				<h2><strong>Managed Kubernetes SaaS:</strong> Why not just use another Kubernetes service as an offering?</h2>
				<p>
					There are many existing tools or services that help you create a Kubernetes cluster (Kops, AWS EKS (managed Kubernetes service), kubeadm, Google GKE) without you being a Kubernates expert. The Kubernetes cluster is just one layer in your software stack.  It is helpful to use one of the cloud-provided solutions for this layer, but it’s not enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					That’s because these tools don’t tell you how to effectively use all of the available features of the cluster. You are still left with lifecycle management functionality; there are continually new updates, features, and techniques that you’ll need to determine how best to incorporate into your application.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will typically use one of these off-the-shelf options to create your Kubernetes cluster as a starting point. If you have extreme requirements on the OS level, which most of these solutions do not let you control, we can talk about rolling our own Kubernetes cluster.

				<h2>Need help integrating Managed Kubernetes Saas with your application or with DevOps? We’ve got you there, too!</h2>
				<p>
					It has become a lot easier to build your infrastructure. You no longer need to write custom infrastructure software and can instead leverage standardized open source software (Docker, Kubernetes, Monitoring/Logging) to build your infrastructure for less than the cost of even one employee (typically for infrastructure that is less than 200 machines).
				</p>
				<p>
					We offer our deep expertise in putting these open source pieces together. As freelancers, we can quickly and economically build your infrastructure because we’ve done it countless times before. While you focus on your application, we will take care of everything infrastructure related.
				</p>
				<p>
					Plus, because the open source community maintains the software, these systems are highly resilient and typically recover from failures. No more middle of the night emergency pages!
